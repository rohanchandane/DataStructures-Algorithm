# Data Structure & Algorithm

- What is DS?
    - Purpose: **To store, organise & perform operations on Data**
    - Humans üë®üèº
        - Thinks in collections: eg collections of items
        - What is collection:
            - Way to store data
            - Has Structure & Format
        - Operations on collection
            - Write, read, update or delete
        - Examples
            - Shopping list
            - Telephone directory
            
    - Computers üíª
        - Use data
        - Store data as collection
            - Has Structure and Format
        - Operations on collections
            - Save, read, update or delete
        - Who creates and perform operations
            - Computer programs
                - Computer program: What is it?
                    - Step by step instruction to solve problem
                    - for machine
                    - Written at implementation time
                    - Once written - Tested
                - Computer programs (are for computer üíª): composed of 2 things
                    - **Data**
                        - Variable: data stored in variable
                        - Data types:
                            - Data categorisation  (number, string, audio, video)
                            - Why categorisation? Easy to perform operations by programs (eg adding number, concat string)
                            - 3 Types of Data Types
                                - **Primitive**: System/Compiler/Programming Language defined data types (eg: string, number)
                                - **Abstract** (**ADT**):
                                    - Provides: a high-level, language-independent view of data + it‚Äôs Operations
                                    - Language-independent Blueprint of the Data Structure (eg. stack, queue etc)
                                    - Allow: multiple implementations of that functionality
                                - **User Defined**: Data types created as per need of user (eg: Employee: id, name, designation)
                        - Data Structures
                            - Are concrete implementations of ADT in a specific programming language
                        - Characteristics of Data Structures
                            - **Linear**: Sequential storage in memory (vs Non Linear)
                            - **Static**: Runtime modification not possible (vs Dynamic)
                                
                                
                                | Static | Dynamic |
                                | --- | --- |
                                | Fast Access | Slow Access
                                Slower Insertion and Deletion | Fast Insertion & Deletion
                                
                            - **Homogeneous**: Stores data of same type (vs Heterogeneous)
                        - Classification (Diagram)
                    - **Operations**
                        - Traversing
                        - Searching
                        - Inserting
                        - Deleting
                        - Sorting
                        - Merging
                - Computer programs: needs 2 things to execute - Different operations needs different time & space
                    - **Space** (memory): to store data structure
                    - **Time**: to perform operation
            - Algorithm
                - Algorithm: What is it?
                    - Step by step instruction to solve problem
                    - for human
                    - Written at Design time
                    - Once written - Analysed
                - Algorithm (are for humans üë®üèº):
                    - Why analyse?
                        - To find out: which logic is better (efficient)
                    - Why efficient algorithm?
                        - To minimise the cost
                    - What affects the cost?
                        - **Time**: how much time it takes to run? (Time Complexity)
                        - **Space**: how much memory it uses? (Space Complexity)
                    - What is Rate of growth (for Algorithm)?
                        - If **more input** ‚Üí takes **more time to run** = Rate of growth (ROG)
                            - (Diagram) `[4,3,2]` ‚Üí Algo ‚Üí `[2,3,4]`   `[4,3,5,2]` ‚Üí Algo ‚Üí `[2,3,4,5]`
                        - 3 scenarios for ROG,  if more input provided
                            - time Increases
                            - time Stays same
                            - time Increase or Decrease (Varies)
                    - Methods to Analyse
                        - When ROG varies, we perform following analysis (Asymptotic Notation)
                            - for Worst case:  (Big O)
                                - (Diagram of worst case) `[4,3,5,2]` ‚Üí Algo ‚Üí `[2,3,4,5]`
                                - Big O notation
                                    - `O(n^2)`
                                        - `(n^2)` : describe time or space complexity. `n` input to the algo.
                                    - Common Big O functions - from Best to Worst

                                    - Good function: function that grows less as input increase
                                    - Bad function: function that grows a lot as input increase
