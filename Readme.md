# Data Structure & Algorithm

- What is DS?
    - Purpose: **To store, organise & perform operations on Data**

    - Humans üë®üèº
        - Thinks in collections: eg collections of items
        - What is collection:
            - Way to store data
            - Has Structure & Format
        - Operations on collection
            - Write, read, update or delete
        - Examples
            - Shopping list
            - Telephone directory
            
    - Computers üíª
        - Use data
        - Store data as collection
            - Has Structure and Format
        - Operations on collections
            - Save, read, update or delete
        - Who creates and perform operations
            - Computer programs
                - What is?
                    - Step by step instruction to solve problem
                    - for machine
                    - Written at implementation time
                    - Once written - Tested
                - Computer programs (for computer üíª): composed of 2 things
                    - **Data**
                        - Variable: data stored in variable
                        - Data types:
                            - Data categorisation  (number, string, audio, video)
                            - Why categorisation? Easy to perform operations by programs (eg adding number, concat string)
                            - 2 Types
                                - **Primitive**: System/Compiler/Programming Language defined data types (eg: string, number)
                                - **User Defined**: Data types created as per need of user (eg: Employee: id, name, designation)
                    - **Operations**                            
                        - Traversing
                        - Searching
                        - Inserting
                        - Deleting
                        - Sorting
                        - Merging
                    - ADT: Abstract Data Type
                        - Data + their Operations
                    - Characteristics of Data Types
                        - **Linear**: Sequential storage in memory (vs Non Linear)
                        - **Static**: Runtime modification not possible (vs Dynamic)
                        - **Homogeneous**: Stores data of same type (vs Non Homogeneous)
                    - Classification (Diagram)
                    - Computer programs: needs 2 things to execute
                        - **Space** (memory): to store data structure
                        - **Time**: to perform operation
                    
            - Algorithm
                - What is?
                    - Step by step instruction to solve problem
                    - for human
                    - Written at Design time
                    - Once written - Analyse
                - Algorithm (for humans üë®üèº):
                    - Why analyse?
                        - To find out: which logic is better (efficient)
                    - What to analyse?
                        - **Time**: how much time it takes? (Time Complexity)
                        - **Space**: how much memory it uses? (Space Complexity)
                    - Methods to Analyse

                        - Big O notation
                            - `O(n^2)`
                                - `O`: represented
                                - `(n^2)` : describe time or space complexity. `n` input to the algo.
                            - Common Big O functions - from Best to Worst
                            - Good function: function that grows less as input increase
                            - Bad function: function that grows a lot as input increase
